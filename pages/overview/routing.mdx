# Routing 

This section describes how to configure routing for the application.

Zero has `Route` class that is responsible for routing.
It is a simple class that has only path and controller properties.

```dart
class Route {
  final String path;
  final Controller controller;

  Route(this.path, this.controller);
}
```

The `path` property is the path that the route will be listening to and is the base path for the controller.
The `controller` property is the controller that will be used to handle the request. Note: Each 
controller can have multiple routes denote by the `@Path` decorator.


## Routing Configuration

Let's see how to add a route to the application.

```dart
import 'package:zero/zero.dart';

void main() {
  final server = Server(
    routes: [
        Route("/books", controller:(req) => BooksController(req)),
    ]
  );
}
```
