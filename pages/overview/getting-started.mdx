# Getting started

In the following set of articles,
we'll create a simple application will help us to understand the basics of the Zero framework.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Dart SDK - v3](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Zero CLI](https://zero.vercel/#installation)

## Setup

First, we need to create a new project using the Zero CLI:

```bash
zero new my_app
```

The project structure should look like this:

```bash
my_app
├── lib
│   ├── controllers
│   │   └── books_controller.dart
│   ├── main.dart
│   └── models
│       └── book.dart
├── pubspec.lock
└── pubspec.yaml
```

Here is a brief description of the files and folders:

| File/Folder       | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `lib`             | Contains the source code of the application |
| `lib/controllers` | Contains the controllers of the application |
| `lib/models`      | Contains the models of the application      |
| `lib/main.dart`   | The entry point of the application          |
| `pubspec.yaml`    | The configuration file of the application   |

The `main.dart` file is the entry point of the application and contains the following code:

```dart
import 'package:zero/zero.dart';

void main() {
  final server = Server(
    routes: [
        Route("/books", controller:(req) => BooksController(req)),
    ]
  );
}
```

The `Server` class is the main class of the framework and is responsible for handling the requests and responses.
It takes a list of routes as a parameter.
Each route contains a path and a controller. The path is the URL of the route and the controller is a function that takes a `Request` object as a parameter and returns a `Response` object.

## Running the application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
zero run
```

Zero supports hot reload, so you don't need to restart the application every time you make a change.
To disable hot reload, use the `--no-watch` flag:

```bash
zero run --no-watch
```
