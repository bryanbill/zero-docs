# Introduction

Zero is a framework for building fast, lightweight and scalable server-side applications.
It is built on top of [Dart](https://dart.dev/)

Zero provides an abstraction layer on top of the Standard Libraries provided by Dart while still exposing the API to the developer.

Zero is built with the following principles in mind:

- **Fast**: Zero is built to be fast. It is built on top of the Dart VM which is one of the fastest VMs out there.
- **Lightweight**: Zero is built to be lightweight. It is built on top of the Dart Standard Libraries which are very lightweight.
- **Scalable**: Zero is built to be scalable. It is built on top of the Dart VM which is one of the most scalable VMs out there.
- **Extensible**: Zero is built to be extensible. It is built on top of the Dart Standard Libraries which are very extensible.
- **Secure**: Zero is built to be secure. It is built on top of the Dart Standard Libraries which are very secure.
- **Agnostic**: Zero is built to be agnostic. It is built on top of the Dart Standard Libraries which are very agnostic.

## Installation

To get started with Zero CLI, you need to install the Dart SDK. You can find the
instructions to install the Dart SDK [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

### Mac OS

```bash
brew tap dart-lang/dart
brew install dart
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dart
```

### Windows

```bash
choco install dart-sdk
```

Once you have installed the Dart SDK, you can install Zero using the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate --source git https://github.com/bryanbill/zero
# Or using -sgit
dart pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/bryanbill/zero
```

This will install Zero globally on your system. Note that you need to add the Dart SDK to 
your PATH in order to use the `pub` command.
